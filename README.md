Project site to showcase work I've completed through Codecademy. The site uses Bootstrap as the framework with some additional custom styling to get the look and feel right. 

Here is the link to the site: https://mattfine.github.io/ 

This project is based heavily on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=215&v=9ayNuQ1XIEI 

The source code for the project in the video is found here: https://bitbucket.org/aklap/bootstrap-portfolio-example/overview
